## About the Project

This project is focused on frontend development, using Next.js and Tailwind CSS to build a sleek, modern, and responsive user experience. Youâ€™ll collaborate with a team to create a beautiful, high-performance website that meets business needs.

## What I have worked on
- **Frontend Development**: Built and enhanced the UI using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
- **Resposive Design**: Implemented clean and intuitive UI components.
- **Real-World Development Practices**: Worked with Git, component-based architecture, and performance optimisations.

## Challenges
As part of the Ido Wedding Celebrants project, I was tasked with implementing the Pricing and Wedding Package pages using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. One significant challenge I faced was creating a responsive pricing table that would maintain functionality and visual appeal across all device sizes. The table needed to display complex pricing packages with features that varied between packages,and included special values like "FREE GIFT" for certain features. Converting from the default table layout on desktop to a card-based layout on mobile required careful planning and implementation. Additionally, working within a team environment meant adhering to established development standards and meeting tight deadlines for a real-world client. 

## Learnings
This commercial project significantly enhanced my frontend development skills. I implemented a responsive pricing table component that maps through data arrays to generate pricing cards, making the component both reusable and maintainable. I have deepened my hands-on experience with Tailwind CSS, particularly for responsive design, using ternary operators to conditionally render different layouts based on screen sizes. I also gained valuable experience version control best practices by following a structured Git commit message standard that improved collaboration with team members. This approach ensured that all code changes were properly documented with appropriate types, scopes, and descriptions. 

Working on a real-world project taught me the importance of attention to details and performance optimisation. Following requirements, I avoided unnecessary libraries and direct SVG imports for icons to make it a fast-loading website. I learned to optimise component redering and ensure consistent user experience across devices. The daily reporting structure and code review process taught me how to effectively communicate technical challenges and solutions in a professional environment. 

## Outcome
The project resulted in a fully functional, responsive pricing page that effectively showcases the client's wedding packages. The pricing component I developed dynamically renders complex pricing tables on desktop and transforms them into user-friendly cards on mobile devices. The implementation successfull met client's requirements while maintaining excellence performance metrics. Working with the team, we delivered the project before the deadline and received positive feedback from the client.
