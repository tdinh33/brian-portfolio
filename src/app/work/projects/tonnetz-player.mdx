## Overview

TONNETZ PLAYER A browser-based “Tonnetz player” will enable users to directly analyse and play with the music harmony. This app allows users to input and modify notes, then play them using the Tonnetz Grid. The project aims to enhance music harmony lessons and support research in the field.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Tonnetz Grid**: 
Visualizes musical harmony using a hexagonal note structure.
Supports clicking individual notes, chords, and trichords to play sounds.

- **Piano Roll Editorg**: MIDI file import/export, note creation/editing with drag-and-drop.

- **Audio-Visual Sync**: Notes played are visually highlighted on the Tonnetz grid.

- **Playback Controls**: Supports play, pause, stop, loop, and recording.

- **Onboarding Tour**: Built using Intro.js to guide new users through key features and UI elements.

- **Onboarding Tour**: Intro.js guides users through key features and UI elements.

## Challenges and Learnings

Positive workplace relationships can be helpful to career fulfilment and success. Understood the
importance of making positive professional connections with team members, during the project
initiation phase, I focused on building good work relationships, ensuring that everyone in the team fit
in well and had a place where they could share ideas and get information on the project. A Discord
channel was our main way of communicating. It gave us a place to work together in ideas, talk about
problems, finisalise works together before a meeting with our tutor and client.
My contribution was to prepare for weekly/fortnightly meetings by making sure that our goals were
clearly in line with client priorities. During Phase 1, I used Min’s MoSCoW to make sure that our
conversations were centred on the most important needs of our client on his “minimal viable
product”
. During Phase 2, I changed how I prepared to follow the sprint plan, making sure to address
progress updates, challenges and solutions since the last meeting, as well as what the client should
expect to see in the next meeting. This method helped keep the conversation with the client focused
and on track of the progress, also to enhance the reliability of our team by giving our client a clear
vision of expected outcomes in the future.

## Outcome

Our artefact successfully achieved its major objectives by creating a usable Tonnetz grid that
depicts the links between musical notes and chords. The client's goals of creating a useful
tool for interactively and captivatingly mastering chord theory are strongly related to this.
With real-time note visualisation on the grid, the artefact allows users to upload and play
back songs in addition to dynamically visualising chords. This feature, which was essential to
the project's scope, guarantees that users may examine current music as well as experiment
with musical theory. We think we have successfully fulfilled the client's expectations by
providing a functional solution that takes care of these essential requirements.
