A key part of this milestone is my graduation from Queensland University of Technology (QUT), where I completed a Bachelor of Information Technology, majoring in Computer Science. As of April 2024, I officially wrapped up an incredible chapter of academic growth, hands-on learning, and countless hours spent coding, debugging, and discovering my passion for building meaningful digital experiences. This degree not only provided me with a solid foundation in computing and problem-solving but also empowered me to think critically and creativelyâ€”skills I now carry confidently into the next stage of my career.
